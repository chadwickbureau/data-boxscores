note: discrepancy - other sources list Webber and Saner first in the 'batteries' summary, which would imply that they started the game - the Gazette recap states that the Helena team '[drove] Dardene from the mound after the second inning, and [pounded] Saner to every corner of the lot during the remainder of the game' - also, the Helena substitutions would also make logical sense if Webber relieved Veasey, as Vandagrift and Webber would have started the game in their regular positions
